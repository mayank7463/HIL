            <p className='text-xl font-bold py-4'>Dear Shareholders</p>
                            <p>It is my privilege to share with you the
                performance highlights of HIL for FY23-
                24, a year that will be remembered as
                the one in which we laid the foundation
                for a ‘Reimagined HIL’.</p>
                            <p className='py-4'>During the year, we continued our growth
                agenda to realise our ambition to be a
                USD 1 billion company over the next 3-4
                years. The recent acquisition of Crestia
                Polytech (Topline), and the resultant
                doubling of our Pipes & Fitting business,
                is a major milestone. We have changed
                the paradigm of our branding efforts
                and reenergised our product innovation
                engine. Value mining for enhanced
                profitability has been established as a key
                organisational priority. Our most decisive
                steps have been towards building the organisation for tomorrow. We have
                strengthened our leadership and frontline
                teams, moved towards a digital-led
                way of working and are building a
                culture of excellence. These steps, I am
                confident, point to an exciting FY25
                and beyond for HIL.</p>
                                <p className='py-4'>At a consolidated level, HIL reported
                revenue of R3,375 crore, with an EBITDA
                of R154 crore for FY24. Within this
                consolidated picture, HIL India delivered
                steady performance in FY24, with robust
                volume growth across most product
                segments. HIL India reported standalone
                revenue of R2,231 crore for the year,
                up 4% from last year. This was achieved
                in the context of a modest demand
                scenario and intensifying competition.
                As a result, pricing pressures remained
                intense throughout the year, including in our polymer business where recordlow PVC prices presented additional
                complexities. Our relentless focus on
                driving operational efficiencies and
                continuous improvement in cost structure
                meant our profitability improved
                across most segments</p>

                                <p className='py-4'>At Parador, we reported a revenue
                of R1,144 crore for FY24. Parador, in
                FY24, presented a story of opportunity
                amidst adversity. Recessionary macroeconomic conditions and weak consumer
                sentiments resulted in a near-meltdown in
                construction activity and flooring demand
                in our core European markets. In this
                environment, we doubled down on our
                efforts to gain market share by expanding
                our playfield to commercial segments,
                agile pricing, restructuring our sales
                teams, seeding new markets, and through product innovation. We also maintained
                relentless discipline on cost and working
                capital to ensure lean operations. The year
                ended with recovery in volume trajectory
                with the business showing QoQ revenue
                growth for the last two quarters and also
                achieving positive operating margins</p>
                                <p className='py-4'>As macro-economic indicators show signs
                of a turnaround, we are confident of a
                smart recovery at Parador in FY25. We
                remain committed to making Parador a
                Euro 500 million+ global brand over the
                next 3-4 years and are confident about
                achieving the same. It is the hidden gem
                in HIL portfolio to watch out for.</p>
                                <p className='py-4'>Roofing Solutions continued to scale
                new heights and delivered highest ever
                sales volume. The Charminar brand that
                carries a 75+ years legacy of trust, further
                strengthened market leadership, price
                positioning and deepened its distribution
                reach. During FY25, we expect both
                volume and price growth leading to an
                improvement in our margin performance.
                We will also be introducing exciting new
                products in this segment to sustain our
                differentiated positioning and further
                grow our market share. </p>
                                <p className='py-4'>In Building Solutions, we had a steady
                performance during the year with volume
                growth across most categories albeit
                with pricing pressures – for instance
                Block volumes grew by 12%, however
                the price dropped by 8%. These
                headwinds on pricing led to muted
                profitability this year. We are however
                aggressively working on several value
                enhancement initiatives to improve our
                profitability and expect significant margin
                improvement during FY25. </p>
                                <p className='py-4'>The coming years are promising for our
                Building Solutions business as we launch
                several new products and continue to
                scout for opportunities for both inorganic
                and organic capacity expansion to
                accelerate our growth trajectory.</p>
                                <p className='py-4'>Pipes & Fittings business has built a strong
                momentum and delivered 12% volume
                growth for the year. Underlying this annual
                picture is a 23%+ growth in Q4 and over
                40% growth in recent months. This growth
                is being driven by targeted distribution
                expansion efforts in the retail segment, as
                well as a focused approach to technical
                sales in the institutional segment.
                Despite significant pricing pressure, the
                profitability of the Polymer Solutions
                business improved significantly by more
                than 300 bps for the year compared to
                FY23, owing to several initiatives across
                supply chain and material costs. </p>
                                <p className='py-4'>FY24 witnessed significant volatility with
                resin prices reaching multi-year lows.
                We believe PVC and cPVC prices have
                largely bottomed (in fact, on an increasing
                trend in the new financial year). This
                should augur well for the overall industry
                especially in terms of arresting drop in
                realizations. With a strong brand legacy,
                superior product mix and value focus, we
                are well positioned to create significant
                value by growing scale in the segment
                and to outpace the market as we have
                done so over the last several years. </p>
                                <p className='py-4'>With the acquisition of Topline, the
                expanded portfolio of products and
                customers will add further momentum
                to our Pipes & Fittings story. The focus
                is on aggressively growing scale –
                organically and inorganically – in
                this segment and create significant
                shareholder value.</p>
                                <p className='py-4'>The performance of our Putty business
                was lower than expected, largely driven
                by industry wide reduction in prices
                and increased competitive intensity.
                However, structural fine-tuning,
                including realignment of the sales
                team and geographical expansion, has
                started yielding results and we expect
                resumption of our growth journey in
                FY25. Efforts on recipe optimization and
                sourcing have meant our profitability in
                Putty is in a healthy zone. </p>
                                <p className='py-4'>Our Construction Chemicals business
                is on a strong growth trajectory with
                revenue nearly doubling YoY – exiting
                FY24 at a run-rate of R85 crore annualized
                revenue. We continue to grow the
                business month-on-month and expand
                our product assortment and grow
                our footprint. We expect FY25 to be
                a breakthrough year for this business
                with both revenue and profitability
                increasing significantly.</p>
                                <p className='py-4'>As we move forward, our commitment
                to building a strong innovation engine
                will drive new product development
                and differentiated offerings. We will
                continue to invest in technology to
                position HIL as a digital-first enterprise.
                Furthermore, we are dedicated
                to establishing green, sustainable
                credentials to meet the demands of an
                environmentally conscious market.</p>
                                <p className='py-4'>Our People define HIL and we continue
                to invest in building an organization for
                tomorrow. Our business achievements
                are led by the sterling contribution of
                our teams – on the shop floor, at the
                frontlines and in our R&D centre. I am
                happy to share that not only have we
                been re-certified as a “Great Place to
                Work” for a 6th consecutive year but also
                ranked as the 12th best company to work
                for in India, a significant achievement for
                HIL. As we march towards our goals, we
                will sustain our enabling work-culture to
                ensure our teams are inspired to take HIL
                to the next level.</p>
                                <p className='py-4'>In conclusion, short-term headwinds
                aside, the fundamentals for all our
                business categories remain robust,
                and we remain on course to becoming
                one of the most admired Home and
                Building brands globally. </p>

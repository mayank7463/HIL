            <p className='text-xl font-bold py-4'>Dear Shareholders,</p>
            <p className='text-2xl  py-4'>As I reflect on the
            past year, I am filled
            with pride and
            optimism about
            HIL’s journey and the
            exciting future ahead.</p>
                        <p className='py-4'>HIL enjoys a legacy that spans over 75
            years and enjoys market leadership and
            strong brand equity across its diverse
            product offerings. In this backdrop,
            the organization has demonstrated
            the courage to “Reimagine HIL” and to
            start execution on the many strategic
            pivots that will put HIL on the path of
            “fast paced, value building growth”.
            This re-pivoting is also timely given
            favorable macro-trends pointing to a
            strong and sustained growth trajectory
            for investments in infrastructure and
            construction sectors in India. </p>
            <p className='py-4'>Financially, in FY24, HIL delivered a
                robust performance with consolidated
                revenue of
                R3,375 crore and an EBITDA
                of
                R154 crore. The year was marked by
                several proud milestones across all our
                business segments, providing an early
                glimpse to the strategic pivots HIL is
                making to pursue its growth ambitions. </p>
                            <p className='py-4'>In the Pipes & Fittings segment, our
                recent acquisition of Crestia Polytech
                (Topline) coupled with strong efforts
                to deepen our channel presence has
                provided us the impetus to be in the
                fast lane of growth in one of the most
                exciting categories in the construction
                and building products industry. Our
                Construction Chemicals business is
                experiencing robust growth, nearly
                doubling its revenue year on year. In
                Roofing & Building Solutions, we have
                recorded our highest volumes and
                solidified market share. To offset price
                headwinds across most categories,
                the team remained sharply focused on driving operational efficiencies
                and continuous improvement in
                our cost structure.</p>
                                <p className='py-4'>During the year we also received
                several awards and recognition across
                our businesses such as Economic
                Times Best Brands, India’s Best Brand
                of the Year and Superbrands awards
                for Charminar and Birla Aerocon; Most
                Trusted Brand award for Charminar and
                Birla HIL Pipes and INEX award for Birla
                Aerocon, Charminar and Birla HIL Putty</p>
                                <p className='py-4'>Despite challenging conditions in
                Europe, the re-energised Parador
                team has seized the opportunity to
                enhance market share by leveraging
                its strengths in product innovation,
                design and quality. In addition, we are
                expanding our areas of play to newer
                geographies and into commercial
                segments. Parador, provides a unique
                global dimension and reach to HIL
                and I truly believe it is one of the most
                exciting parts of our portfolio.</p>
                                <p className='py-4'>Underlying these “early wins” are
                carefully calibrated investments in
                building a strong engine for product
                innovation, branding and marketing
                and for building a digital-first
                organisation. Equally, Environmental,
                Social, and Governance (ESG) factors
                are central to our strategy, reflecting
                our care for people and communities.
                We are committed to not only
                developing eco-friendly, sustainable
                products and practices but also
                partnering with customers to prioritise
                environmental responsibility. As a
                testament to our continued focus on
                building sustainable and eco-friendly
                products and processes, we received
                the prestigious GRIHA certification
                for our AAC Blocks, Panels and Pipes
                and “Green Pro” award for cPVC
                Pipes and Fittings. </p>
                <p className='py-4'>Our People are central to HIL’s success
                and our vision is to build a futureready organization that is responsible,
                agile, and innovative. I extend my gratitude to all of our team-members
                for passionately and tirelessly creating
                value for our stakeholders. Their
                contributions at every level of the
                organization are invaluable, and we
                remain dedicated to building a culture
                of excellence, trust, and inclusion. I am
                proud to share, that HIL has recently
                been ranked 12th amongst “Great
                Places to Work” in India. </p>
                                <p className='py-4'>This year, we have also deepened
                the impact of our CSR activities by
                partnering with the Live, Love, Laugh
                Foundation for improving rural mental
                health which has led to significant
                improvement in the lives of thousands
                of individuals. This program has
                already impacted over 13,500 lives
                across the country</p>
                                <p className='py-4'>On behalf of the Board of Directors,
                I sincerely thank all our stakeholders
                for their unwavering support and trust.
                We are confident of our path forward
                and remain dedicated to creating
                long-term value as we strive to become
                one of the most admired Home and
                Building brands, globally</p>
                <p className='py-4'>Warmly,</p>
